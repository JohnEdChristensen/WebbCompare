# Contributing to WebbCompare
ðŸŽ‰Thanks for your interest in contributing!ðŸŽ‰

### Code of Conduct
Be nice, help people learn.

### Bugs
Use Github issues.

### How Can I Contribute?
Post ideas and requests to Github issues as well!

If we come to a consensus that your idea would be a good fit, make the change, and submit a PR.

### What Can I Contribute?

Keep these things in mind for the direction I would like to take this project:

- The target audience is the __general public__, not astronomers, science enthusiasts, or other domain experts
- Content should be as __accessible__ as possible
- As much as possible __show don't tell__, let readers discover insights themselves. Guide them to interesting ideas, but let them discover the insights themselves.

### Style
This project was written pretty quickly (between the time the first image was released and the next day when the remaining images were released) so there are some aspects that aren't super clean. 
It is slowly being cleaned up as areas are touched again, but feel free to refactor messy things if you run into them. 

I have no strong preference on a specific style standard to, but I'm open to suggestions if that would make the project more readable.

### Branches
The site is published using Github Pages from the `gh-pages` branch. For now submit PR to this branch. 
If you have advice on how to best handle branching (should we have a dev branch?) let me know.
I'm not familiar with maintaining an open source project *yet*.

### Launching Locally
There shouldn't be any external depencies. I use  [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) with VSCode to run the website locally, but you should be able to use whatever you want!
